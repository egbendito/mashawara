! Standard Soil Profiles
!
! The following generic information was developed by A.J. Gijsman:
!
! - BD was estimated as BD = 100 / (SOM% / 0.224 + (100 - SOM%) / mineral BD)  
!   (Adams, 1973; Rawls and Brakensiek, 1985).
! - LL and DUL are according to Saxton et al., 1986.
! - SAT was taken as a fraction of porosity (Dalgliesh and Foale, 1998):
!   0.93 for soil classes S, SL and LS; 0.95 for soil classes L, SIL, SI,
!   SCL and SC; and 0.97 for soil classes C, CL, SIC and SICL.
!   For this, porosity was estimated as: POR = 1 - BD / APD (in which APD
!   is the adjusted particle density, i.e. corrected for SOM; Baumer and Rice, 1988).
! - The ranges of LL and DUL values were calculated by stepping through the
!   complete texture triangle in steps of 1% sand, 1% silt and 1% clay (>5000 
!   combinations), but with the texture limitations that Saxton set for his method
!   taken into consideration. For SAT, these limitations do not hold, as this was
!   based on POR and not on Saxton. See Gijsman et al., 2002.
! - The root growth distribution function SRGF was was calculated as:
!   SRGF = 1 * EXP(-0.02 * LAYER_CENTER); SRGF was set 1 for LAYER_BOTTOM <= 15.

! The 12 Generic soils for SOIL.SOL, as estimated by Arjan Gijsman:
!
! - LL, DUL are according to the Nearest Neighbor method (Jagtap et al, 2004)
! - Ksat at -99 
! - BD according to Gijsman et al (2002)
! - SAT based on the APSRU manual (Dalgliesh and Foale, 1998); i.e. 93-97% of porosity
!   depending on the soil type) in which porosity is according to Baumer and Rice (1988).
