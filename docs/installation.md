# Installation

The tool is designed to be deployed in a [CG Labs](https://labs.scio.systems/) like environment under its current deployment in the
CGIAR system. In subsequent updates the tool will try to rely on cloud available data to make it system agnostic.

## 1. How to install?

To create an instance of the DST, the user should clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/egbendito/mashawarar) and execute
the following code:

```
This is a sample block of code
Here the ./setup.sh should go. Look at github repo
```

## 2. Configuration

Users can compile their own version by cloning the repo and running
```
remotes::install_github("reagro/carobiner")
ff <- carobiner::make_carob(path)
```
where `path` is the folder of the cloned repo (e.g. "d:/github/carob")

You can also compile your own version of the full carob by clicking below

[Compile Carob](http://www.google.com){: .btn}

Or compile the CC-BY data below

[Compile Carob CC-BY](http://www.google.com){: .btn}

## 3. How to upgrade

In future releases and updates of the tool the user will need to re-start from scratch... But better not do it like that...
