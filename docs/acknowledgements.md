## Acknowledgements

The tools has been co-developed in the context of the Excellence in Agronomy (EiA) initiative from CGIAR for the Sasakawa Nigeria Use Case,
with partners from Sasakawa Nigeria Foundation; Bayero University of Kano, Nigeria; CIMMYT and IITA. The TRANSFORM workpackage provided
technical support, while use case partners provided the agronomy and context expertise. This activity is financially supported by the CGIAR 
with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-005460).

This tool relies on the kind contributions from multiple public and open source projects. We would like to show our gratitude to the 
[DSSAT Foundation](https://dssat.net/development/development-team/) as well as the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html)
and data products from the [Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home), [iSDA Soil](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85639-y),
[CHIRPS](https://chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps) among many others. We truly walk on the shoulders of giants.
