# About Mashawara

Mashawara stands for "maize advise" in Hausa language of Northern Nigeria. The tool works as stand-alone software aimed to provide
agronomic advisory for multiple crops on opimal time of planting and variety selection. The DST is based on [DSSAT](https://dssat.net/)
software as a backend engine, and implemented with a set of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) scripts relying on several other R packages
(see [dependencies](installation.html#3-requirements)). This software is part of [Excellence in Agronomy](https://eia.cgiar.org/) and was initiated
with the support of the [Sasakawa use case](), thus the name. It has been later expanded to other use cases, regions and crops to 
provide a dynamic tool easily deployable and updated.

A PDF manual of this tool is available at the CGIAR resource repository, [CG Space](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstreams/49aadf06-8507-466d-85e7-f28eeb725c78/download).
